# Welcome to my Tic_Tac_Toe game:


My Tic tac toe game is a python based game which is ran through Code Insitute's mock terminal on Heroku.<br>

Users can play a one on one game of Tic tac toe against a computer A.I. On a board that consists of Nine squares number 1-9.<br>

# Future Features:

- A shot timer.
- A scoreboard. <br><br>

# Testing:
- I sent my live link to family and friends so they could play the game.
- I ran it through my local terminal and the Code Institute Heroku terminal.

# Bugs:
- I had a few indentation errors.
- I also had spelling errors.
- I had bug in my code when the user entered a number the game stopped working, it was a simple mistake in my print statement.
- I fixed these bugs by carefully reading over my work.

# Remaining bugs:

# Validator:
- PEP8
- - No errors were returned on https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ <br><br>
